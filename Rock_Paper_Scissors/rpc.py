# Program Flow:
# Define choices (r, p, s)
# Define emoji for each choice
# Define rules (what beats what)

# Loop
# Ask the user to make a choice (r/p/s)
# If user input is invalid
# Print error message
# Continue to next loop iteration

# Let the computer randomly choose (r/p/s)

# Print both choices using emojis

# If user choice == computer choice
# Print "Tie!"
# Else if user beats computer using rules
# Print "You Won!"
# Else
# Print "Computer Won!"

# Ask user if they want to play again (y/n)
# If input is 'n'
# Break the loop
