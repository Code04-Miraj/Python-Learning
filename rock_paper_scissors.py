# Program Flow:

    # Define emojis for rock, paper, scissors
    # Define rules (what beats what)

    # Define a function to get user input
        # Ask user to enter rock/paper/scissors
        # If input is invalid, raise error

    # Define a function to get computer's random choice

    # Define a function to decide winner
        # If same: draw
        # Else: check rules to determine win/loss

    # Main game function:
        # Loop forever:
            # Try getting user input
                # If invalid, print error and continue loop
            # Get computer choice
            # Print both choices with emojis
            # Print result (win/loss/draw)
            # Ask if user wants to play again
            # If not, break loop and end game

# self written project
